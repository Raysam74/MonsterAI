##MonsterAI

This repository contains very early experimental test scripts for a horror monster AI concept in Roblox

Important notes lol :
- This is NOT a finished system
- Scripts may not work as-is
- This is a first prototype and logic test only
- No monster model
- No animations
- No sounds
- No real player integration yet
- Many important systems are missing

The goal of this project is to experiment with AI behaviors such as:
- Blind monster logic
- Sound-based detection
- Light fear and stun reactions
- Ambush logic
- Contextual attack decision making

Everything here represents an early testing phase.
A lot of features, polish, optimization and gameplay systems are still missing and will be added later.
